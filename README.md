This contains various coding exercises and practice problems that I have encountered or created in my journey in bioinformatics. Resources I used include Coursera "Finding Messages in Our DNA (Phillip Compeau, Pavel Pevzner) class, Single Cell Analysis course (https://www.singlecellcourse.org/), Rosalind, and more (to be updated).
